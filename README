This is a workaroud for single sign on to iTunes U from concourse. For now, the concourse management group doesnt feel comfortable installing the Login2 powerlink on the product concourse. So the users have to type in their netid and password again to access the course content on iTunes U. Users are still authenticated through LDAP, all the authenticated users are assigned downloading permission.
